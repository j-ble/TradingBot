    "HOW TO FIND WHALE WALLETS:",
    "1. Go to DexScreener and find a token that did 10x-50x recently",
    "2. Look at the 'Top Traders' section on that token's page",
    "3. Find wallets that bought early (within first hour) and sold at peak",
    "4. Check their wallet history on blockchain explorer (Solscan/Etherscan)",
    "5. If they have multiple 5x-50x wins, add them here",
    "",
    "EXAMPLE SOURCES:",
    "- DexScreener top traders on successful tokens",
    "- Solscan 'Top Holders' of tokens that pumped",
    "- Twitter/X crypto traders who share their wallet addresses",
    "- Bubblemaps whale detection",
    "",
    "TIPS:",
    "- Look for wallets with 60%+ win rate on new tokens",
    "- Avoid wallets that hold tokens for months (we want snipers/scalpers)",
    "- Best whales buy within first 1-24 hours and sell within 1-7 days",
    "- Track 5-10 wallets to start, add more as you find proven ones"

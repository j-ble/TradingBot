# Coinbase Exchange APIs Overview

## Key Announcement

The FIX 4.2 Order Entry Gateway faces deprecation on **June 3rd, 2025**. Users should leverage the newer, more performant FIX 5 Order Entry Gateway instead.

## API Categories

The platform divides offerings into two main types:

- **Trading APIs**: Require authentication; enable order placement and account access
- **Market Data APIs**: Publicly available market information

## Connectivity Options

Coinbase Exchange provides four primary integration methods:

1. **REST API** — Suitable for lower-frequency trading and standard requests
2. **FIX Order Entry API** — Designed for higher-frequency trading scenarios
3. **WebSocket Feed** — Delivers market data streams
4. **FIX Market Data API** — Optimized for latency-sensitive data feeds

## Important Terms

Users accessing Exchange Market Data APIs must comply with the Market Data Terms of Use. The Exchange APIs integrate within the broader Coinbase Developer Platform, which offers comprehensive access to Coinbase's complete API ecosystem and blockchain infrastructure resources.
